Daisyquest is a number that varies.[often used for quests or renamed to Daisyquest, see boris for some good examples of this, totally unneeded if the npc doesn't have an associated quest.]
LastDaisyfucked is a number that varies. LastDaisyfucked is usually 250.
Daisyfucked is a number that varies. Daisyfucked is usually 0.

Daisy is a woman.[or woman]
The description of Daisy is "Standing off in one corner of the room and trying to catch your attention without the other mares noticing is a rather youngish looking maregirl. A closer look at the mare shows that she is still only partially transformed, though her body is definitely showing the signs of her equine transformation. The tight electric blue g-string she is wearing shows off her newly enlarged cunt and new distinct cameltoe, and her face is almost completely equine and pushed out  into a proper muzzle while her ears have elongated into points and settled into their new position on top of her head. Her legs have also changed, although it is clear they are not quite complete yet, as they are longer and thinner and her heels have shifted upwards, forcing her to walk on her stiffening toes, they are well on their way to being proper digigrade legs like the rest of the mares.  Her half fearful half lust crazed look as she stares at you desperately makes you shudder as you realize how easily you could end up in her position.";


The conversation of Daisy is { "[Daisytalking]" };

To say Daisytalking:
	if Daisytalk is 0:[first time you encounter the npc text]
		say "'Hey, you just arrived here didn[apostrophe]t you? Do you mind if I ask you a favor?' The partially transformed girl asks, before blushing and looking down for a minute. 'Oh sorry, I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Daisy, and I am kinda new here myself, so they are still teaching me how to interact with clients and studs.' Daisy says with an embarrassed shrug. 'It[apostrophe]s great being here and all, and everyone is so nice and helpful, and I know I am so lucky to be here with all these handsome stallions around waiting to fuck me and fill me their foals...' She smiles dreamily for a minute as she rubs her bare breasts absently with her hands, before shaking her head slightly and looking at you again.[line break]";
		say "'But it still feels like something is missing, and I was kind of hoping you could help me figure out what it was, if you don[apostrophe]t mind that is?' Daisy says with a small smile, 'I know I can[apostrophe]t take up too much of your time or the other mares will start to get jealous, but if you could stop by occassionally and talk to me I would really appreciate it, and maybe it would help me remember what it was that I seem to be missing.' the maregirl says with a slight grin as she looks at you hopefully, her smile broadening  when you reluctantly nod in agreement. 'Great! I know I was somewhere else before they brought me here, because I remember all those nice handsome stallions with their big thick cocks bringing me here. But I can[apostrophe]t really remember much else about that time, though I think I might have been a student of some kind, and while they tell me that it must not be important if I can[apostrophe]t remember it, I just feel like something is missing. So maybe if you talk to me about the city out there occassionally it will help me remember, either that or it will remind me of how much better off I am as a good little mare in here, and I can stop worrying about it.' Daisy says with happy smile, before looking around and seeing that several of the other mares have noticed your little talk, and shooing you along for now.";
		increase Daisytalk by 1;
		stop the action;
	if Daisytalk is 1:[Normal short messages the npc will say each time you talk to them]
		say "[one of]'Hey again, got any good stories for me?'[or]'I wonder what it is that could be missing from my life... there is plenty of food, and mares to keep me company, and soon I will even get to play with the stallions! What more could a mare want?'[or]'I know I was human before, but that just seems like such a waste, being a mare feels so much better!'[or]'Shhh, you don[apostrophe]t want them to think I am monopolizing all your time!'[or]'I wonder what kind of studs I will end up servicing when I finally finish my training...'[or]'You should try being a mare sometime, it[apostrophe]s wonderfully relaxing just to let someone else make all the decisions for you, while you lie around in the rooms until a nice customer or stud comes along...'[or]'I wonder if I will ever have any foals... that would be so nice...'[or]'I understand they have breeding mares somewhere else in the building, I wonder what they are like?'[or]'Fancy is a nice mare, she helps take care of the rest of us, though she seems a bit lonely herself sometimes.[at random]";





Instead of fucking the Daisy:
	if lastDaisyfucked - turns is less than 6:
		say "'.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		say "'Sorry, but I have to pass on that, while it would be kind of nice to be used like a proper mare, i haven[apostrophe]t managed to finish my training yet, and they say I can[apostrophe]t work with any customers until I know how to properly service them.' Daisy says with a shy smile, 'Though maybe you could come back once they say I am ready and you could ride me then?' She continues as she looks at you hopefully."; 




Daisy ends here.
