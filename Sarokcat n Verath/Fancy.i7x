Fancy is a man.[or woman]
The description of Fancy is "A rather sexy looking mare eyes you with amusement from where she is seated at the small table she is using as a desk, wearing only her soft pelt of white horse fur and a set of white panties that reveal far more then they conceal. Her body is well built, and nicely rounded in all the right places, the horsewoman has nice strong thighs, and her powerful hooves stretch out in front of her, her legs slightly parted teasingly as she gives you a good view of her tightly stretched panties. She rests her equine muzzle on her slightly hooflike hands as she looks at you with anticipation, her deep blue eyes twinkling with amusement as she cocks her ears forward to hear what you have to say.";


The conversation of Fancy is { "[Fancytalking]" };

To say Fancytalking:
	if Fancytalk is 0:[first time you encounter the npc text]
		say "'Well hey there, interesting to see a new face all the way over here.' The white mare says with a smile on her muzzle, before chuckling slightly to herself. 'Let me guess, the receptionist is off playing with that donkey toy of hers again, and there was no one at the front?' She says with some amusement as she looks up at you, when you just shrug, she sighs and continues. 'Yeah well, figured as much, well since they let you in here you must be a customer of some stripe, either that or a very fast talker, either way, welcome to 'The Stables'.' The mare says as she leans back and halfheartedly gestures with one of her hooftipped hands at the building.[line break]";
		say "'It might be a bit old and all, but it[apostrophe]s still nice and sturdy, and above all pretty damn secure, which has certainly become a more important factor due to recent events.' The mare says, before focusing her attention back on you fully. 'The names Fancy, and I[apostrophe]m kind of the mare in charge of this area, though it doesn[apostrophe]t take much to keep things running smoothly enough. Though it certainly could be a bit better if we could only get some proper supplies.' Fancy says with a shrug, 'Still, this is the Mares quarters, which as you can see, is where all the mares stay and hang out when they aren[apostrophe]t 'working'.' She pauses for a minute as she grins at you, stretching her hooves out in front of her teasingly as she leans back on her stool slightly. 'In case you haven[apostrophe]t figured it out yet, the stables is a 'working house', a pleasure palace, or to put it pretty bluntly, a proper whorehouse. It used to be people would come here on trips or vacation, and the women would come over from the red light district, and do some 'room service' of their own.' Fancy says as she watches your reaction with amusement. 'Now the owner just rents out members of his 'stable' to anyone who has something to trade, I understand he used to be an avid collector of horses at one point, and now well, he just moved on to collecting a different type of horseflesh.' The mare says with some amusement.[line break]";
		say "'So that[apostrophe]s the basics, though I am sure you had figured most of it out for yourself already, after all, you did come here for a reason I[apostrophe]m sure.' Fancy says with a smile, before sighing, 'Sad to say though, most of us mares over here are relaxing for now, and while I am sure you could certainly manage to entice several of them to play with you, they really are supposed to be resting and waiting their turn.' She says as she glances around at the few mares hanging around nearby pretending not to be listening. 'So if you are looking for some fun you should head back and go through the doors to the main building, north of the reception desk. Of course if you just want to hang around with some mares, well feel free to hang around here as long as you want.' Fancy says with a smile as she shifts her weight forward to give you a nice view of her ample breasts. 'And I[apostrophe]m sure if you hang around here a while we can certainly find ways to help you fit in so to speak, and maybe you could even help me get this place fixed up a bit if you wanted. It would certainly be appreciated after all.'";
		increase Fancytalk by 1;
		stop the action;
	if Fancytalk is 1:[Normal short messages the npc will say each time you talk to them]
		say "[one of]'Hanging around the mares area some more? We are always glad to see a friendly face.'[or]'Back again? Maybe you are interested in a position here at the Stables? Or maybe even several positions?' Fancy says with a suggestive grin.[or]'Those damn horsemen are always breaking things on accident, and never fixing them. I swear...'[or]'Try some of the food over there on the table, you might like it.'[or]'So, what do you like in a mare?' Fancy asks you teasingly, 'Breasts, legs, or ass?' She says, her hands rubbing over each part in turn as she watches your reactions.[or]'Were you looking for something here? Or maybe you were looking for someone?' Fancy asks you teasingly.[or]'I wish I could get some help around here sometimes, I only have two hooves after all!'[or]'You know what one of the best parts about this place? When they say hung like a horse around here, they really aren[apostrophe]t kidding!' Fancy says with a snicker.[or]'It[apostrophe]s good to have a nice safe stall to sleep in here while things go to hell out there, you should try it yourself sometime.'[or]'Enjoying the Stables so far?'[at random]";





Instead of fucking the Fancy:
	if lastFancyfucked - turns is less than 6:
		say "'";
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		say "'Sorry, there friend, but I think we should keep things professional between us, for now anyways.' The sexy white mare says with a teasing wink, 'Maybe after we get to know each other better, we can really 'Get to know each other,' but until that happens...' She shrugs softly, and gives you an equine grin as she leans back on her stool, her long equine tail swishing across the ground absently behind her."; 




Fancy ends here.
