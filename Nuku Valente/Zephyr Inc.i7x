Zephyr Inc by Nuku Valente begins here.

"It[']s about time for Zephyr to show up around here."

This is the zephyrad rule:
	say "A voice suddenly chimes out from your radio, 'Good day, wastelander. This is Zephyr Incorporated. After much demand, we have moved a branch office into your fine city. Coordinates follow. We here are Zephyr Inc are dedicated to the betterment of mankind through science. To start, we are rewarding all with a bounty on defeated hostiles. You will be alerted to your winnings. Put your money away. The US Government has collapsed, so we use a currency of our own devising, Free credits, also known as freecred or just creds. When you have some, swing on by and spend them on useful survival gear. We look forward to meeting you shortly.'";
	now zephyr lobby is known;
	
Zephyr Lobby is a room. "This is a small Zephyr Inc branch. Their power is hard to argue with, as they actually have power, with brightly lit flourescents shining down from above. The floor is clean and swept. To the left are some chairs next to a table with old magazines on it. A few people loiter around, eating doughnuts and chatting, all in various stages of mutation. Your eyes are drawn to a [link]list[as]look list[end link] that hangs above the counter." It is fasttravel. It is private.

Larissa is a woman. "Manning the counter is a female human with no clear signs of mutation. Her name badge declares her to be 'Larissa'.". She is in Zephyr Lobby.

Zephyr Inc ends here.
