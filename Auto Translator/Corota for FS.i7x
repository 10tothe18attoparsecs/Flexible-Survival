When Play begins:
	Choose a blank row from Table of random critters;
	now name entry is "Corota"; [Name of your new Monster]
	now attack entry is "Corota uses their [one of]Scythe Sweep[or]Tail Slap[or]Poison Bite[or]Raking Claws[or]Pollen Haze[or]Wing Dust[or]mutant power[at random]"; [Text used when the monster makes an Attack]
	now defeated entry is "Due to the split nature of your mutations, you're left wondering just what to do Corota. [if stat mutation/head of you = Corota]Your head, the most dominant part controlled by the mutation, decides for you, demanding you must be milked! [if you is male and Corota is female][if stat Corota/venom of you > 2]Your venom levels not yet to the point that they're painful, you realize it's some other "gland" that feels heavy with its burden. Body a slave to instinct, you quickly mount Corota's defeated form while working your member to fullness. [if stat mutation/cock of you = corota]In seconds the split organ is ready for use, and taking no care with Corota's bruised form you shove both halves into their open hole at once. The artificial tightness of squeezing your members together, along with your own need to be emptied, makes the copulation short, in seconds flooding the insides of Corota with your seed.[otherwise]In seconds your cock is ready for use, and taking no care with Corota's bruised form you shove it into their open hole. Your altered thoughts, along with your own need to be emptied, makes the copulation short, in seconds you're flooding the insides of Corota with your seed.[end if] Finished, and with your body firmly back in your control, you recoil from Corota as though they are as venomous as your fangs, leaving them to clean themselves up.[set the Corota/venom of you to 0][otherwise]Venom glands swollen in your mouth, you're more than willing to use Corota to decrease the pain they cause you. You slam your fangs into Corota's side and milk out as much of your venom as you can. This is very dangerous for them, but there was that saying about whatever doesn't kill and making you stronger and whatnot.[increase the Corota/venom of you by 1][end if][otherwise]Venom glands swollen in your mouth, you're more than willing to use Corota to decrease the pain they cause you. You slam your fangs into Corota's side and milk out as much of your venom as you can. This is very dangerous for them, but there was that saying about whatever doesn't kill you and making you stronger and whatnot.[increase the Corota/venom of you by 1][end if][otherwise][if stat mutation/torso of you = Corota]Wings heavy with their burden of accumulated dust, you realize nobody besides Corota, and maybe not even them, would mind you lessening the load on them. Turning your back to Corota, sure they're too tired to take advantage of the opening, you shiver, vibrating your wings in place until a small cloud is formed between them. Flapping your wings once, then twice, you billow the dusty substance over Corota and the ground around them. Feeling lighter now, wings cleaned off, you wonder what to do next with the day.[otherwise][if you is female and Corota is male]Looking down at them now, you feel almost sorry about what you have done. They gave it all they had for the sake of survival, and their performance wasn't exactly terrible. It might not be so bad to reward them. Yes, you could carry their young for them, and even if they died here they... Hey! What are you thinking?! Shaking your head viciously, slapping at your cooch, you shake away the lusty thoughts before they're something more. Obviously you're not quite so contemptuous towards everyone else as the wild Corotas on the street.[otherwise]Unable to come up with anything in particular for them, you remember, as if through a fog, that you don't have to do anything at all. Whatever you wish to do is your choice! Smiling at the triumph of free will, you leave Corota in the dust to satisfy yourself in a manner of your choosing.[end if][end if][end if][line break][line break]";
	now victory entry is  "[one of]Mind muddled trying to stay focused on the battle, you fail to catch the sweep of the tail until almost too late. Only by acting in the last second do you go from taking a scythe in the gut to having yourself smashed to the floor. Seemingly satisfied with "only" flooring you for the count, Corota stomps off to vent its frustrations on another victim.[or]Focusing on the tail and great claws of Corota, you forget about the obvious threat until it's already in your face. Literally. Your cheeks explode in pain as two great fangs sink into them, being used to inject a significant amount of poison into your mouth. You barely have the time or desire to consider that a half foot higher or lower, and you might not be in a position to ever complain again. When the fangs finally pull out, Corota smashes you roughly to the ground with a two handed overhead strike, and you're left there sputtering, and spitting blood and toxins from your mouth. While you've heard eating a rattlesnake's toxin is harmless, you aren't in the least bit willing to test that out with infected snake bites.[or]A low sweep by Corota's tail knocks you to the ground, the chimeric critter quickly leaping upon your prone form and clawing at it with their leonine half. Fortunately, they don't seem to strike anything vital before they get bored with you, crawling off your sore body and giving it a final, hard stomp to the gut before hurrying off.[or]Out of breath, and needing a breather, you try to pull back from the fight with Corota to regain your breath. For a moment, it looks like Corota is going to allow you to do so, turning their back on you and beginning to walk away. Then you notice the small cloud of dust forming between their wings, too late to get out of the way or close your mouth before Corota sends the dust cloud straight into your open mouth with a quick flap of their wings. Gasping now in pain as the particles cling to your throat and insides of your breathing organs, you haven't the environmental awareness to notice them repeating the action again and again. Face going blue, you pass out to wake up some time later covered in the ochre dust, throat raw and demanding a drink soon.[or]Corota brings you to the ground with a rough sweep of their tail, staring down at your broken and bruised form. [if you is male]Sniffing at the air with nose and tongue, Corota smiles down at you in a way only a feral can. "Yes, strong mate. Deserving mate," she hisses, going between your legs and working your length with her forked tongue. Whether it turns you on or you merely struggle, suddenly there is a painful sensation in the base of your cock as Corota appears to have bitten into you with their fangs. Bringing their head up to smile at you, again with that feral look, you can see a venom of a different color than normal dripping from their fangs.[line break][line break]You don't have long to consider what they did before your length explodes to full, veins bulging as it's forced to be ready for Corota. Too weak to crawl away, too tired to push them off, you're forced to watch as they spread their lower lips before spearing themselves on your cock[if stat cock length of you > 12], your head forced rapidly past their cervix into their waiting womb[end if]. Bouncing up and down on you pole, "poison" no longer necessary to keep you readied, you are stuck for some time with nothing but the wet squelching noises and Corota's impassioned hisses to distract you.[line break][line break]Eventually, body's betrayal complete, you give Corota their much desired seed, balls swollen by the venom forcing some of your own liquefied mass into them along with your regular load amount. The milking goes on for almost five minutes, and you don't want to consider how much of your mass was "recycled" for their pleasure while you watch their belly slowly bloat wider and wider. When the flow finally comes to a halt, you feel more spent than you have ever felt before. Corota doesn't even seem to give you a cursory look as they waddle off, their footfalls followed by the sound of an occasional wet impact as thick wads of spunk fall between their legs.[otherwise][if you is female]"Thirsty from fight," they hiss, diving between your legs greedily. In seconds your labia and hips are covered in a mass of nonvenomous bites, Corota's many hands slapping at your hips as they seem to forget that you aren't a giant jug of fluid. Whether they beat you until terrified beyond control, or the rough abuse is one of your special buttons, you eventually give Corota their much desired drink. Not even bothering to give so much as a "Thanks," Corota stomps away from you to slake the rest of their thirst elsewhere.[otherwise]Failing to see anything that catches their interest, Corota gives a snarl and turns around, raising both their tails high to bring down on you. Raising your arms to shield your face, you barely have the time to sigh in relief as each miss your arms and head by scant inches. You were so weak, for it to be seemingly beneath Corota to even bother to make sure they've finished the job. Corota flaps their large wings to take to the skies, leaving you coated in a small layer of their dust.[end if][end if][at random][line break]"; [ Text used when monster wins, can be directly entered like combat text or description. or if more complex it can be linked to a 'To Say' block as the demonstration text shows.]
	now desc entry is "Looking over Corota, her body is covered in ocher, darkly veined flesh. Her head is snakelike, set above a long neck. Two vicious horns jut through her brow, while her fangs are longer than expected for a snake her size.

Two large, leathery wings spread from her back, golden brown dust hazing around her. She has 2petite breasts. Her arms are human in shape, but she is gifted with two too many.

Just as you feel a sensation that can best be described as ripping start from the tip of your face to the base of your neck, you hear a tearing sound, and your head and neck split apart, turning into a pair of functioning halves.

	now body change entry is "You're left gasping for air as your body tightens, some of its mass shifting through you and settling in your back.
