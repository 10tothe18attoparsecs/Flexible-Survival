Section 1- The Mysterious Shop

The Mysterious Shop is a room.

The description of The Mysterious Shop is "Bells jingle softly as you enter this rather quiet and eccentric shop, this strange shop seems to be still open and doing fine even without power. Softly scented candles cast a dim light over shelves covered with strange and unusual items which seem to be displayed in no discernable order.  You can[apostrophe]t see any of the normal things you would expect to find in a mall shop however, no nicely packed boxes, no brand name items clamoring for your attention, no well marked shelves, just a rather large strange assortment of items spread out as far as the eye can see. Children[apostrophe]s toys are placed next to expensive looking decorations,  candle holders lying next to ornamental fans from the orient, almost as if someone merely grabbed anything that interested them, and then spread their new treasures out for people to see. Compared to most other shops you have been in, this one seems quite strange and mysterious indeed although with the city in the state it is currently in you probably shouldn[apostrophe]t be too surprised at the strange things you find, although for some reason you can never quite remember seeing this shop here before....";
Nermine is in The Mysterious Shop.

Nerminefound is a number that varies.
LastNerminefucked is a number that varies. LastNerminefucked is usually 250.
Nerminefucked is a number that varies. Nerminefucked is usually 0.

Nermine is a woman.
The description of Nermine is "You spot what must be the store owner, her strange countenace making you blink several times in surprise.  Leaning up against the store counter next to the register is a lovely Female Jackaless, her soft black fur shining softly as she is framed in the soft light from the candles on the counter.  The rather Anubis like figure seems to be currently dressed in a rather loose fitting white t â€“ shirt as she leans forward on the counter, her face is brushed with soft swirls of silver paint as she grins at you.";


The conversation of Nermine is { "[Nerminetalking]" };

To say Nerminetalking:
	if Nerminetalk is 0:
		say "'Ah a new customer!' The strange jackal says with a grin as you approach the counter, her voice soft and beautiful though tinged with a strange accent you don[apostrophe]t quite recognize. 'My name is Nermine, and I will be happy to help you out with whatever you need!' The jackal woman continues, the candlelight shining off her eyes and her silver makeup as she tilts her head to get a better look at you. 'You look like you have plenty of problems, well don[apostrophe]t worry! Whatever the problem, Nermine[apostrophe]s shop probably has some solution for it.' Nermine says with a small smile, 'Of course use solution at own risk and all that, and some of my items might not come that cheaply..' She continues, her light voice seeming tinged with amusement as she gestures around at the strange array of items scattered around the shop, 'Or perhaps you just wish to try your luck yes? Nermine has several items that might be fun for you to try out relatively cheaply...' She gestures at the small bin near the counter marked 'Bargain bin', 'Either way, you let Nermine know what she can do for you, or with you.' The sexy Jackaless says with a wink of her silver painted eye, making you wonder if she meant that last comment to be quite as suggestive as it sounded...";
		increase Nerminetalk by 1;
		stop the action;
	if Nerminetalk is 1:
		say "'[one of]You need help finding what you need? Nermine can help![or]Don[apostrophe]t hesitate to ask me any questions you might have![or]You say shop was at other end of mall before? Are you really sure?[or]Doesn[apostrophe]t the candlight seem rather romantic and mysterious to you too?[or]Have you tried our new vanishing drinks? Nermine will give you free sample as soon as she can find where they went...[or]I hear there is a nice museum in this town, maybe you can find some nice items there as well.[or]I keep meaning to go see what happened at the egypt exhibit, but it doesn[apostrophe]t do to leave the store unattended for long...[or]I am actually enjoying the strange things going on outside, I get fewer odd looks from the customers now, of course I get fewer customers as well...[or]Did you know jackals were considered to be very mystical animals and sacred to Anubis?[or]What a very fine [cock of player] cock you have there!' Nermine says, with a smile, making you blush[or]I like your [skin of player] skin, but Nermine very much prefers her own soft fur, it is a lovely shade of black don[apostrophe]t you agree?[at random]'";






Instead of fucking the Nermine:
	if lastNerminefucked - turns is less than 6:
		say "'Sorry, I know you want to have more fun with me, and I certainly wouldn[apostrophe]t mind having some more fun with you,' The jackaless says with a soft wink, 'But I do have a store to run here sadly, and even if I don[apostrophe]t have many customers to take care of, and definitely no customers as nice as you, who knows what trouble the stock would get up to if I wasn[apostrophe]t here to keep an eye on things most of the time.' She says as she gestures with one of her black furred hands at the shelves full of odd items packing the store. 'Don[apostrophe]t worry though, we should be able to have a little time to ourselves again as soon as I have taken care of things here, do come back and see me then!' Nermine says, a small grin pulling at the edges of her black muzzle as she stares at you with lust filled eyes.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		now lastNerminefucked is turns;
		say "'Sorry, but Nermine[apostrophe]s sex scenes are still under consideration by higher powers known as game writers,' The jackal woman tells you, her strange terms making you blink,  'Do not worry though, Nermine is looking forward to much fun times playing with you, and is sure they will get to it very quickly before Nermine puts curse on them.'.";

Section 3- Magic Bargain Bin

Bargain Bin is a man.
The description of Bargain Bin is "This large bin seems filled with a number of small packets, bottles, and charms, who knows what you could find in there? Above the bin someone has posted a recently drawn sign reading, 'You try bargain bin? You pull it out you bought it, one pick for one packet of food and one bottle of water.' Reading the sign you aren[apostrophe]t exactly sure just how much of a bargain this bin really is right now, but you could still find something useful right? Maybe you should try HUNTing a bargain, or SORTing through the bin?";

Nermine says as she takes the small urn from your hands, and places it down on a shelf somewhere behind the counter.  'Nermine only hopes bad luck hasn[apostrophe]t rubbed off on you already, she will give you kiss for luck to make sure.' The Jackal says as she leans over the counter even  further, her black muzzle brushing over your mouth even as you open it to respond.  Before you know it her tongue is exploring your mouth even as her muzzle rubs up against your face, in what is actually a surprisingly pleasant kiss. After a second, she pulls her tongue out of your mouth, leaving you standing there slightly stunned as she gives you another soft lick across the cheek. 'There that should counter any bad luck urn might have given you, let me know if you find the sneaky thing in bin again.' The sexy jackaless says with a wink as she returns to her normal place at the counter.  After a second you realize that you now don[apostrophe]t have anything to show for your hunt through the bargain bin, but at least you got a nice kiss for your efforts? That[apostrophe]s something of a bargain isn[apostrophe]t it?";

Sighing you take a look at the pouch, and realize it is empty, and just another small storage bag to you. At least it looks like it can be strapped easily to your backpack, as you tie your new pouch onto your backpack, you begin to put a few small items in it just to help sort things out, and are surprised to realize that items in your new pouch don[apostrophe]t seem to weigh much of anything compared to those outside the pouch.

As you slowly look through the papers, you find yourself growing increasingly more and more aroused by the strange scenes you find depicted there, wondering just how it would feel to take part in some of those actions.  Hearing movement behind you, you quickly fold the papers up and stick them in your pack with a blush as you notice Nermine leaning over curiously to see what you are staring at so intently.
