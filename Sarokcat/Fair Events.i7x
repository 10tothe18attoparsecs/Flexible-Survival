He glances around for a second, and tries to just grab one of the prizes and drag it out of the booth instead, and you watch in horrified fascination as his hands seem to sink into the giant stuffed dragon he tried to steal.  The man screams and continues to curse, as his body seems to lengthen even as it shrinks, and before you know it he is hauled up into the booth by his stuck hands, and turns green and gold covered in plush dragon fur.  By the time you reach the booth, the screaming has stopped and there are now two fancy plush dragons hanging in the prize area, as you stare at them you can swear one of them winked at you for a second.

The squeaky fox appears to be ducking and squeaking out silly commentary, while the latex cat tries to slap some sense into the fox. Which is amusing enough, but when the large latex tiger starts banging their heads together indiscriminately, you cant help but giggle, at the absurd situation, and the looks on the two beasts smooshed together faces. You pause for a minute, afraid you might have attracted their attention, but the beasts spare you only a glance before they go back to their escalating argument, with more silly gestures and slapstick fighting.  You find yourself laughing hilariously at the strange situation playing out in front of you, especially when one of them grabs a pie off one of the nearby food carts, and the food starts flying.  Still chuckling, you leave the fight before any of the food can start flying your way, but the smile stays on your face for quite a while afterwards, and you feel much better about yourself.”;

You eventually blink, and tear your gaze away, and stagger onwards, but for some reason your brain is full of images of you staying in the fair, working one of the booths, or being the furry plushie prize for some lucky winner at one of the booths.

Regardless of what you do, his spiel doesn[apostrophe]t seem to change any, and moving closer, you note that his feet seem to have become attached to the barkers stand, anchoring him there as he repeats his speech over and over again.

Eventually taking a chance, you duck into one of the ferris wheel cages, and slam the door shut, hoping they won[apostrophe]t find you.  To your surprise the wheel starts up again right away, swinging you up and away from your pursuers, and giving you a great view of the fair itself, as you go higher you can see the entire ruined skyscape of the city spread out before you, and the ominous smoke rising from near the capital building.
