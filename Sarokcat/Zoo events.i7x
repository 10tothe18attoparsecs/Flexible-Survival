Taking advantage of the situation, you move inside and start searching the place, although it really doesn[apostrophe]t take much looking to find the locked case of what look like extendable cattle prods, obviously intended to shock dangerous animals at a small distance.  Unfortunately the case is locked up tight and all your efforts to pry it open fail miserably, though you do notice someone has placed a sticky note up in the corner.  Reading the note you find it says 'Electric shock treatment available in release 2.0! preorder now!'  Well isn[apostrophe]t that just dandy....";

Instead of Resolving a Hyena cages:
	say "You come across an enclosure that looks like it was burst open from the inside, taking a closer look you notice it looks almost like some of the bars were bitten clean through!  Taking a careful look at the plaque you find that this was actually once the hyena enclosure! Well now you know where all the hyena[apostrophe]s wandering the city came from, and here you thought it was just the natural evolution of scavengers into scavenging hyenas.... still as you are about to leave you note from the 'fun facts' section that the hyena has one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom, strong enough even to chew through metal.... you resolve to be more careful next time you face one of the cackling beasts.";

Unfortunately he is stranded in the middle of one of the more open enclosures, on a rock in what appears to be a lake of cum.  You blink at the sheer amount of the stuff coating the area, but are distracted by some rough slapping sounds underneath the hoarse cries of the trapped employee.  Looking around you are shocked to spot two massive mounds of grey flesh going at it not far away, their sheer size making it hard to recgonize them as humanlike elephants instead of say, small buildings.  You find yourself gaping at the riduclous size of the one on the bottoms cock, then clap your hands to your ears as they both trumpet, the one on top erupting into the one on bottom, and the one on bottom erupting everywhere.  The trapped employee moans, as the lake of seed around him rises even higher, the elephant herms take a minute to rest, before switching positions and starting up again.  Sadly you really don[apostrophe]t see any way you could reach the employee to help with anything short of a helicopter, and you certainly aren[apostrophe]t up to taking on two large foes that size.  Shaking your head you move off into the zoo, trying not to shudder at the soon to be elephantine employees cries.";

The sarea of Snake knot is "Zoo";

Instead of Resolving a Snake knot:
	say "Traveling past the snake house, you decide to chance a glance inside, only to stare in amazement at a writhing knot of snakes of various sizes filling the room. The smell of snakes and sex fills the room, and their hissing is only broken by the occassional moan or cry of ecstacy, proving that there were a few non snakes caught up in their mating knot at one point, though you are sure they are snakelike by now. Carefully you back away from the door, not desiring to get caught up in their mating frenzy, though it could be fun to try if there were fewer of them.....";

Unfortunately it seems several other people or creatures were here before you, and it was obvious not much 'resting' occurred, although several of the participants were probably horizontal at one point.  Looking around you take in the splatters of cum from several unidentified participants, several articles of shed clothing tossed around haphazardly, and a variety of mixed animal prints tracked in the dirt.  You really aren[apostrophe]t sure just who all or what all enjoyed themselves here, but they definitely had lots of fun.  Sighing you leave without taking a rest, the scene making you too nervous, and aroused, to stay there any longer.";

	say "I don[apostrophe]t know what the bear is up to out there, but there was a lot of grunting just a minute ago, and there is a strange smell in here now... it smells kinda... good.  For some reason the shack seems to be a size too small now though...";

You back off out of sight of the panda as it trots past, seemingly intent on moving as fast as it can down the path.  You are about to come out of hiding, when another more beastial panda comes trotting down the path moving quickly, this one is obviously female and it quickly chases after the retreating male panda.  The second panda is swiftly followed by two more female pandas, each batting at each other as they try to get ahead, and finally one last slightly pandalike female trailing along after everyone else, the final one still kicking off its encumbering clothing as it continues to change into a full panda.  Slightly amused at the strange situation, you wait to be sure there arent any more girl pandas chasing after the obviously very popular guy panda, before coming out of hiding and continuing on your way.";

Entering the petting zoo you are only slightly surprised to find the area empty, more surprising is the large amount of childrens clothing and a number of backpacks scattered around on the ground, obviously there was a school bus visiting the area at some point recently.  You sigh as you look around, then give a halfhearted search of the backpacks lying around, you find several items of food and water, and decide to take them with you.

Soon you are caught up in all the tips and tricks the training tape teaches to aspiring zookeepers on how to handle the animals and deal with any trouble.  An hour later when the tape clicks off, you find yourself feeling much more confidant about your ability to deal with any animals or beasts that you might come across.";
